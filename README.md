The HTML structure defines a fixed-position navigation menu that is visible on all pages. Each menu item is wrapped in a <nav> element.
The CSS file styles the navigation menu, ensuring it is fixed at the top, and includes styles for the hover and scroll effects.
The JavaScript file adds event listeners to handle the scroll effect and menu item hover interactions.
